The project features a layered architecture, including a data access layer (DAL) for managing entities such as Categories, Products, Users, Roles, Purchases, Memberships, and Card Details. 
It showcases best practices in model validation, database configuration, and repository pattern implementation.

Key Features:
•	Entity Framework Core code-first database design
•	Repository pattern for data access abstraction
•	Model validation using data annotations
•	Sample CRUD operations for multiple entities
•	Clean, modular, and maintainable architecture

This project is ideal for learning or demonstrating modern .NET 8 development techniques, especially for those interested in building scalable and testable applications with EF Core.
