DemoApplication_Code_First is a sample ASP.NET Core application that demonstrates the use of Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach. 
The project features a layered architecture, including a data access layer (DAL) for managing entities such as Categories, Products, Users, Roles, Purchases, Memberships, and Card Details. 
It showcases best practices in model validation, database configuration, and repository pattern implementation.

Key Features:
